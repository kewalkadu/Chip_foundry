Microwatt as a Sensor Fusion Hub

This project aims to extend the Microwatt CPU core into a specialized sensor fusion hub by integrating standard hardware interfaces and a dedicated fusion accelerator.

Microwatt will be enhanced with interfaces such as IÂ²C, SPI, UART, and GPIO, enabling it to connect directly with a wide range of sensors commonly used in IoT and robotics applications. To efficiently process incoming data streams, a lightweight hardware fusion accelerator (e.g., implementing a Kalman filter) will be integrated alongside the core. This accelerator will offload sensor fusion tasks from the CPU, providing faster and more power-efficient data processing compared to a software-only approach.

The project demonstrates its value through a practical use case: Microwatt gathers data from an accelerometer, gyroscope, and temperature sensor, and then fuses this information in real-time. The fusion process generates reliable and accurate system state estimates, which can be used for decision-making in robotics, autonomous systems, and IoT devices.

By completing this project, we showcase:

Clear real-world applicability: Sensor fusion is essential for balancing robots, stabilizing drones, and enabling smart IoT devices.

Reproducibility: Since Microwatt is open-source and FPGA-compatible, others can replicate and build upon this work.

FPGA-to-ASIC flow demonstration: The project highlights a realistic hardware development path, starting with FPGA prototyping and extending to potential ASIC implementation.

Ultimately, this project transforms the Microwatt CPU core from a simple processor into a specialized sensor fusion platform, bridging the gap between general-purpose CPUs and application-specific hardware accelerators in embedded systems.
